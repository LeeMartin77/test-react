# React Technical Test

This is a simple technical test involving react and react router.

Note: The backing "store" for this application is DummyJSON.

You will want to make use of the documentation here:

```

```

## Installing/Running

You will need node. Specifically this has been built on node v24.7.0 - and has the relevant `.nvmrc` file to match this.

With node installed:

Get dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should then be available on http://localhost:5173 (this will have a different URL in the coder environment).
